# crane app

This is an app I'm working on where users can login and answer questions about different types of cranes to practice for tests, similar to DMV practice apps.

The server is on a separate repository, https://github.com/benjaminJohnson2204/craneapp-server, and was created with MongoDB, Express, and Node.

The client code was created with Flutter and Dart. So far, I've only coded an authentication system and some of the code to display categories and questions, but the project is still a work in progress.
